1. Calibration is meant to show that the model is working a accurartely and validation is making sure the model is working consistently
2. Aethetics are data visualizations yhat map data values into quantifiable features, these could be shapes, sizes or colors.  
3. The original is better
4. The first is qualitative color scale which is used to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, the second is sequential color scale which is used to represent data values, the third is diverging color scale which is used to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint, and the last is accent color scales which is used to highlight specific elements in the data.  
5. Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data
6. No, The rain at 10 am is not the physical cause of the clouds at 9:45 am
7. 1 No because it ignores the first half of the graph and only focus on the second half, 2 the estimates of the glboal temperature, 3 negative corelation, 4 yes because it is consistent with the year gaps, 5 the average is .070925
8. Classical and Bayesian probibility.
9. Beyesian probibility.
10. Frequentist, as it requires an abundant source of information and there is no abundant source of information about God.
11. The data starts before the Year 0.
12. Because computers only recognize the on and off signal represented by the 1 and 0.
13. The BCPL,Basic Combined Computing Language
14. Fortran
15. Using distributive you can show that -c(-a+-b)=ca+cb and -c + (-a-b)=(-c+-a)(-c+-b)
17. Aâˆ¨-Ais true. If -Ais true then A->B is true by reversing it therfore -B->-A is true
18. Deductive and plausible reasoning, Deductive would be it is raining because it is cloudy and plausible would be it is going to rain because the clouds are turning grey and grey clouds indicate rain
19. It means they have the same value
20. ![Question 19](https://github.com/MavDouglas48/IDS2024S/assets/157654744/7904c212-37d0-4309-a104-f8a08f2791fd)  
21. No
22. 3,366,by adding them all together in a calcualtor
