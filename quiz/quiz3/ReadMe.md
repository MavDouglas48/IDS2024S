1.Prediction, creating an idea from natural phenomena, Observational data, take what data we can from our seneses, model construction, creating an example to test our data,calibration and validition, proving prediction using data and model  
2.experiment,theory,computational   
3.In computer programming, in astronomy where planets cannot be measured, Weather forcasting  
4.Deducitve and Plausable reasoning, In deducitive reasoning you could say "If it is raining it must be cloudy" and in plausable reasoning you could say "It will be cloudy at 10:00 so it will be more plausible that it will rain at 10:00  
5.Logical implication is not the same as physical causation, The rain at 10 am is not the physical cause of the clouds at 9:45 am.  
6.George Boole  
7. and 8.![Question_7_8](https://github.com/MavDouglas48/IDS2024S/assets/157654744/aa33f664-c3fa-49d8-a51b-7a7e133c441e)  
9. That both propositions are equally plausable  
10.![Question_10](https://github.com/MavDouglas48/IDS2024S/assets/157654744/ddcc87d6-231d-4d03-96ac-4668ca064238)  
11.![Question_11](https://github.com/MavDouglas48/IDS2024S/assets/157654744/283cdaf8-7fd2-4bca-818d-2e5225a89230)

14.Because A ‚Üë -ùê¥-B  
15.  
16.  
17.Because A correlates with B in the sense that if A is true then B is true and if B is false then A has to be true    
18.Generaly yes as i do feel like we went over logical understandings quite well however i do feel like we did not go over the NAND and NOR operations and their inclusion made this quiz feel less fair than the last two.
