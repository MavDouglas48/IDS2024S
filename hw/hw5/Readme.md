1. The visual representation of a graphic, shapes, colors, sizes  
2. Those that can represent continuous data and those that cant  
3. quantitative and qualitative, Quantive example is how many were a part of a poll and qualitiative is how people thougt of the poll
4. Categorical
5. Ordered could be good, ok, bad and unordered could be Dog, cat, Human
6. The month column is discrete, ordered, qualititaive, categorical / The day column is continuous, ordered, quanitative, numerical / The Location column is discrete, unordered, qualitative,categorical /
   The station id is discrete, unordered, quanitative, numerical / and the temperature column is dsicrete, unordered, quanitative, numerical
7. The x and y when they are equal
8. A chart that shows change over a year but the x axis is in days chaning it to months could improve the visualization
9. The bottom left
10. data of a periodic nature such as continous or ordered sets
11. qualitative, distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, / sequential, to represent data values / diverging, visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint / accent,  highlight specific elements in the data
12. The data starts before the year 0
13. The first set
14. 2. Honolulu is hotter, 3. Honolulu has less deviation, 4. For honolulu you have y = 0.0259x + 25.327 and R² = 0.0031 and duluth has y = 0.0365x - 32.878 R² = 0.0002, they have negative corelation, the two cities would also have negative corelation because sidney also has a very warm climate

17. Classical Probability, Empirical Probability, Subjective Probability, Axiomatic Probability

19. 4
20. Take the bottom left stick from the 8 making it a nine and adding it to the zero making it an 8 so 9+3-4=8
21. 4
