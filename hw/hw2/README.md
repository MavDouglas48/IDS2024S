2-ENIAC-Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer  
3-Because only understands the on and off signals represented in 1s and 0s  
4-Cache memory  
5-Hard Disk  
6-A bit  
7-Assembly Language, yes
8-Fortran, about 7 or created in 1957  
9-FORTRAN, Fortran,c and c++ 3rd, Matlab,R , Python 4th,

16-80 times  
17-twenty times  
18-400 times    
19-act as switches  
20-they result in lower speed and increase power consumption  
21-Fetch,decode,execute  
22-yes, there are other factos such as a worse internet conenction or if a hard drive or SSD is in use  
23-memory,its become less efficant as we improve them  
24-Moore's law works by adding more switches and dennard and MOSFET work to make computers smaller
